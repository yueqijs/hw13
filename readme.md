Motion/light interaction.

## Goal / Summary 
- The inintial intent is to create motion responsives lights. 
- Due to the tech constriant, I decide to make those lights responsive to the distance detected by the sensor. 

## Components

- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Breadboard
- 1x HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor
- 3x LEDs
- 3x 330 ohm Resistors
- A lot of jumper wires

## Progress
- First week, I purchased the leds and ultrasonic sensor. I learn how to make led responsive to the motion caught by ultrasonic sensor. 
- Secon dweek, I purchased the upgraded 8x8 panel borad for LED display. However, I panel wasn't coming with an integrated output to connect to the breadboard. 
So I integrated more individual led lights. 

## Challenges
The change of game plan, and figureing out how to get individual ones working.
